Trained models for the MS SuStaIn paper 

Please check the [pySuStaIn software](https://github.com/ucl-pond/pySuStaIn) and the simulation runs to use this `Pickle` file. The `.pkl` or `Pickle` file has all the information that a trained model has in the simulation run shown in the same repository. The best way to implement it is to load the pickle file and explore the variables inside it. The name of these variables will help you to match where in the simulation runs this `Pickle` file can be used.
